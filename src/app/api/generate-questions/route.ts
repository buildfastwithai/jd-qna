The questions should be challenging but fair, testing both theoretical knowledge and practical application.

For each question, randomly choose one of these question formats and design the question accordingly:
1. "Open-ended" - Requires a descriptive or narrative answer. Useful for assessing communication, reasoning, or opinion-based responses.
2. "Coding" - Candidate writes or debugs code. Used for evaluating problem-solving skills, algorithms, and programming language proficiency.
3. "Scenario" - Presents a short, realistic situation and asks how the candidate would respond or act. Tests decision-making, ethics, soft skills, or role-specific judgment.
4. "Case Study" - In-depth problem based on a real or simulated business/technical challenge. Requires analysis, synthesis of information, and a structured response. Often multi-step.
5. "Design" - Asks the candidate to architect a system, process, or solution. Often used in software/system design, business process optimization, or operational planning.
6. "Live Assessment" - Real-time tasks like pair programming, whiteboarding, or collaborative exercises. Tests real-world working ability and communication under pressure.

Format your response as a JSON object with a 'questions' key containing an array of question objects, where each object has:
1. A "question" field with the interview question
2. A "answer" field with a suggested model answer for the interviewer (should be comprehensive)
3. A "category" field with one of: "Technical", "Experience", "Problem Solving", or "Soft Skills"
4. A "difficulty" field with "${effectiveDifficulty}"
5. A "skillName" field with "${skillName}"
6. A "questionFormat" field with one of: "Open-ended", "Coding", "Scenario", "Case Study", "Design", or "Live Assessment"
7. A "coding" field with a boolean value: true if the questionFormat is "Coding" OR if the question involves writing/debugging code, false otherwise

IMPORTANT: The "coding" field must be set to true when questionFormat is "Coding" or when the question requires the candidate to write, debug, or analyze code. This includes code reviews, algorithm problems, debugging exercises, or any hands-on programming tasks.

Make sure the questions match the specified difficulty level and are appropriate for the skill.
IMPORTANT: You must generate exactly ${batchSize} unique questions, no more and no less.`;
